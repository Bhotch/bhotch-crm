### 2. Large Photo Format Support ✅ VERIFIED

**Status:** Already supported! No fixes needed.

**Formats Supported:**
- ✅ JPEG/JPG
- ✅ PNG
- ✅ WebP
- ✅ HEIC/HEIF (iPhone photos)

**Files with Proper Support:**
- [ControlPanel.jsx](src/features/visualization360/components/UI/ControlPanel.jsx:218) - `accept="image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/webp,image/heic,image/heif"`
- [CameraIntegration.jsx](src/features/visualization360/components/PhotoCapture/CameraIntegration.jsx:468) - `accept="image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/webp,image/heic,image/heif"`

---

### 3. Photo Upload "Add Photo" Functionality ✅ WORKING

**Status:** Photo upload functionality is working correctly.

**How It Works:**

1. **Single Photo Upload:**
   - User clicks "Upload Photo(s) - Up to 8" button
   - File picker opens
   - User selects 1 photo
   - Photo goes through validation (PhotoValidator component)
   - After validation, photo is compressed and set as "before" image
   - User can now visualize products on the photo

2. **Multiple Photo Upload (3D Reconstruction):**
   - User clicks "Upload Photo(s) - Up to 8" button
   - File picker opens with `multiple` attribute
   - User selects up to 8 photos
   - Photos are processed for photogrammetry
   - First photo is set as "before" image for immediate visualization
   - Background processing begins for 3D reconstruction

3. **Camera Capture (8-Photo Workflow):**
   - User clicks "8-Photo Capture (3D)" button in Phase 2 Features
   - Camera integration component opens
   - Guided workflow for capturing 8 specific angles
   - Each photo captured or uploaded is validated
   - All photos processed for 3D reconstruction

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ File size validation
- ✅ Image format validation
- ✅ Resolution warnings
- ✅ Blur detection
- ✅ Brightness checks
- ✅ Corruption detection

---

### 4. React Hooks Dependency ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** PhotoValidator.jsx had an ESLint warning for missing dependencies in useEffect.

**File Fixed:** [PhotoValidator.jsx](src/features/visualization360/components/PhotoCapture/PhotoValidator.jsx)

**Changes:**
- Wrapped `performValidation` function in `useCallback` hook
- Added `onValidationComplete` to dependencies array
- Removed ESLint disable comment
- Updated useEffect to include `performValidation` in dependencies

**Before:**
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (file) {
    performValidation(file);
  }
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [file]);

const performValidation = async (imageFile) => {
  // ... validation logic
};
```

**After:**
```jsx
const performValidation = useCallback(async (imageFile) => {
  // ... validation logic
}, [onValidationComplete]);

useEffect(() => {
  if (file) {
    performValidation(file);
  }
}, [file, performValidation]);
```
