1. Train custom model using TensorFlow/DeepLab for roof segmentation
2. Export to TensorFlow.js format
3. Place model files in `/public/models/surface-detection/`
4. Update model path in `AISurfaceDetection.js`

**Note:** The system will automatically fallback to heuristic detection if model is unavailable.
